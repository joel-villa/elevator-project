# Motion simulation

Motion simulation is our solution to not having actual hardware. It informs the
sensors on if they should be triggered or not, moves the elevator in
accordance to the constants defined in Util.Constants.
Motion simulation does not talk to the api directly, but instead
talks to the *actual hardware.

*The 'actual hardware' is a mockup of the hardware, which decisions are being informed
by motion simulator, see Hardware, and Simulation.MotionSimulation.
