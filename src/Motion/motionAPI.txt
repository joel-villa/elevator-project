# Elevator Controller
This is the main software that controls the movement of our elevator.
It starts, stops, and changes direction of the motor and provides information
on the sensors to maintain accurate floor alignment.

## Methods
### void start()
The elevator starts moving in the set direction, accelerating at rate acceleration
up to the specified max_speed. See Util.Constants

### void stop()
Starts decelerating until the elevator stops. See Util.Constants for deceleration constant

### void set_direction(direction)
Sets the direction of elevator movement. Starts at null(no direction choosen)

### Integer top_sensor_triggered()
Returns the floor number associated with the triggered top sensor.
If no sensor is triggered, this method returns null.
When bottom_sensor_triggered() returns the same floor, the elevator is aligned.

### Integer bottom_sensor_triggered()
Returns the floor number associated with the bottom sensor of the floor that was
triggered by the car. If no sensor is triggered, this method returns null.
When top_sensor_triggered() returns the same floor the elevator is aligned

Note: The package 'Elevator_Controler' was deleted as it looked redundant, if I was wrong to do so
it may need to be re-added later. Only MotionAPI.java and this was kept, and this txt file was renamed. - Alex Maynes Team 10
