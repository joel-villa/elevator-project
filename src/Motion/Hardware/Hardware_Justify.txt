# Hardware
Representation of the actual hardware, talks to MotionAPI through the software bus.

## Elevator
Keeps track of its y position (double) in space, with the lower and upper limit
of the elevator.
Can return where it is (upper and lower y positions) and update its y position.

## Motor
Can set its direction, turn on and off and update those watching it.
See Util.Observable
It is observed by motion simulation, so motion simulation can inform the other hardware,
such as moving the elevator up/down when the elevator is on.

## Sensor
A sensor object can be triggered (by the elevator passing it) and return that information.
It also updates those watching it. See Util.Observable.
It is being watched by the sensor GUI.
